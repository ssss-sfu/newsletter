  },
  "articles": [
    {
      "header": "Item 1",
      "sections": [
        {
          "subheader": "January 1st, 12:00 PM @ SRYE 5050",
          "text": ["Text goes here. Visit https://www.sfussss.org/ for more.", "Next Paragraph"]
        }

  ],
  "signature": {
    "name": "Gahee Kim",
    "position": "Secretary",
    "endingNote": "And that's all from me! Peace!"
  }
}
```

### Special Formatting
- `header.description` and `articles[i].sections[j].text`
  - Links supported (URL)
  - Bold text supported `<b>...</b>`

## Warning

Implementation is intentionally outdated because SFU Mail tends to break new features.
Don't turn the tables into flexboxes, nor use advanced CSS selectors.
Images are referred by CDN because the email use-case necessitates support on a file-systemless reader;
Images aren't embeddable inside HTML (investigate Base64 embedding) so they must be referred externally.
